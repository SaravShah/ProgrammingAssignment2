## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}
## MakecacheMatrix creates a special vector which is really a list containg a function to find the inverse of a matrix


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ##this will calculate the mean of the special vector, it firsts checks to see if the mean has been calculated, then it will get the mean from the cache and skip the computation
        
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
